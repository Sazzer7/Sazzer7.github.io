    <td>We started the lesson with a couple of lines of code to get us on the go. Once we knew the basic structure it was easy to make a simple quiz on Python. When I decided to start again, I found it helpful to be sitting next to someone that I could copy the main structure and then sort of personalize it. Another much more major way I learnt, was through trial and error. It helped to move things around a bit and was a huge relief when it worked.</td>

    <td>The things that I struggled with this week was being creative. Despite being a big fan of art, I still struggle with the creative side so I found it difficult to think of questions to ask. Another thing that I found difficult was order because there was a lot "if"s and defining words. It got very confusing.</td>
