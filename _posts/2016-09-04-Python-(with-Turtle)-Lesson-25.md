    <td>This lesson was very much a lesson of independent learning. As soon as we entered the room, it was heads down work on our turtle shapes, at first I decided to work on my initials: SJB, and having completed that, I stupidly deleted the work, therefore I dont have a record of it :( Anyway then I moved on to a cool pattern. Now, this time I was careful not to delete it. This time, i copied the html onto a google doc before i did anything else. Now it looks really cool, it has a black background and a lot of squares that make up a cool pattern, also when it is finished, it shows writing saying COOL PATTERN by SJB.</td>

    <td>The main that limited my learning was my clumsy selecting of my work, this lead to me accidently deleting all my work. But the good news was that I finished my work. 

Next lesson, I will be more careful when I am trying to copy my work.   </td>
