    <td>This lesson, we started with going into the other room, so that our teacher could explain to both classes, what we were doing. We were shown how to make a turtle appear and we were shown how to make it move around in shapes. Then we were shown how to make it move around more than once, this allowed us to make more detailed pictures.
For example I made a parachute out of two circles for the turtle.</td>

    <td>The things that made my work slow, were the fact that if you made the variables too high, the computer crashed, and I did this one or two times. Another thing was the aspect of there being not enough time for me to get as much work as I could have got done. So next week i will no doubt have a lot more time to get work done anyway. 

Overall, I feel like I had good lesson, the work is making a lot of sense, I look forward to doing some more work on python.</td>
