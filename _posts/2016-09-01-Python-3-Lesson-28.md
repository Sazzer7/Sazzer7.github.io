    <td>This lesson, I decided to do some research to help me with thinking of ideas (last week's issue was my lack of imagination). I only had time to do one though and it was a quiz asking which foods I would choose and, based on them, I would be told where my dream place to live would be. In terms of upgrading my work, I added more code to help with the accuracy of the answers, previously it just said something stupid as a result according to the results, but now gives a percentage and depending on that percentage, the comment changes.</td>

    <td>This lesson, I struggled with the lack of time and that was basically it. Next lesson i just need to speed up so that i can accomplish more work and get it done. The other problem was the usual situation of my work accidentally being deleted but fortunately I only deleted small amounts of work despite previous lesson where I lost all of my work.</td>
