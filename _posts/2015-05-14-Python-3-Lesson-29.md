    <td>This lesson I spent mostly doing some work on the reaction to certain answers. For example I used the code type: wrong(1,2,3â€¦). It was quite easy upgrading it today because last lesson I spent some time doing some research. That shows that the strategy of doing some research and having some inspiration is very effective.    </td>
