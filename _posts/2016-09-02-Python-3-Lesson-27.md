    <td>We started the lesson with a couple of lines of code to get us on the go. Once we knew the basic structure it was easy to make a buzzfeed on Python. I felt very happy when I figured out how to adapt the code given to us, in a way that greatly improved my work. This lesson was very much focused on imagination as much as using code. The difference between this lesson and any other IT lesson though was the fact that we basically were given the baseline for the code and the main work that we had to do was the imagining. Unfortunately I struggled as bit on this, so i was grateful to be sitting next to someone that had a great imagination in terms of foods - my topic for the buzzfeed, "what is your favourite food out of the following".</td>

    <td>Like I said already, I struggled a bit on the imagination side of this lesson. Obviously though there were the usual problems, like when the computers glitch in the way that means all my work is deleted. Next lesson I look forward to being able to improve my work and make it much better, by being more careful with my work and what I click and stuff like that.</td>
